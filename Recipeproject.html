        <div>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="ulIng">
        <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons milk (adjust as needed to form a smooth dough)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for frying</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
     <h3 id="35">Recipe</h3>
     <ol class="olIng">
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add ghee or butter to the dry ingredients and mix using your fingertips until it resembles bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Slowly add milk, a little at a time, and knead until you get a smooth and soft dough. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too dry, add a little more milk.        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure there are no cracks, as they can cause the Gulab Jamun to break while frying.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat. The oil should be medium-hot, not too hot,<br> or the Gulab Jamun will cook too quickly on the outside and remain uncooked inside.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the Gulab Jamun balls into the hot oil, a few at a time, depending on the size of your pan. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the Gulab Jamun balls on low heat, turning them gently with a slotted spoon to ensure even cooking until they turn golden brown. This process may take about 7-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once golden brown, remove the fried Gulab Jamun balls from the oil and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Let the fried Gulab Jamun balls cool for a couple of minutes, then carefully add them to the warm sugar syrup.</li>
        <li>Allow the Gulab Jamun to soak in the sugar syrup for at least 1-2 hours before serving. They will absorb the syrup and become soft, moist, and flavorful.</li>

    <h1><i><b>Waffle</b></i></h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="ulIng">
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted (or vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <ol class="olIng" >
                <li>Preheat Waffle Iron: Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
                <li>Prepare Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
                <li>Mix Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter (or oil), eggs, and vanilla extract (if using) until well combined.</li>
                <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients.<br>
                    Use a spatula or wooden spoon to gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.<br> 
                    The batter should be smooth but slightly thick.</li>
                <li>Grease Waffle Iron: Lightly grease the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray or brush it with melted butter to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Cook Waffles: Pour an appropriate amount of batter onto the center of the waffle iron, spreading it evenly using a spatula. <br> Close the lid and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions until the waffles are golden brown and crisp.</li>
                <li>Serve: Once cooked, carefully remove the waffles from the waffle iron and transfer them to a plate. Serve immediately with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or powdered sugar.</li>
                <li>Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining batter until all the waffles are cooked.</li>
